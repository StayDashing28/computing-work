_Aki's POV__

**â€œEmergency Meeting!"**

   I sighed in annoyance at the sight of the words on my smartwatch. Was it  playing pranks again? This was the fifth time today!Grudgingly,I made my way to the hall.       
   "I swear, if I catch  pressing the button again, I will-"declared Jaleen angrily.Many others nodded in agreement, as no one liked to climb down flights of stairs and climb up to the sixth floor again upon realising that nothing had happened. Just then, I caught sight of , the infamous class clown, running into the hallway while panting.
   
   He was followed by a weeping Becky, who held a white blanket in her hands. Whispers echoed throughout the hall as Becky gingerly placed the  blanket on the long marble table, only to reveal a bloody mess inside.
    
   "M...My dog Lucky was k..killed. Who can be so cruel as to do such an evil deed?" wailed Becky.
    
   Some of Becky's friends went to comfort her, while the chairperson, Kazuha, asked:"Where did you find Lucky's body?"
   
   "O...On the fifth floor, next to the power reactor room."
   
   This statememt was greeted with whispers and gossip. The power reactor room was a highly radioactive place and not many people dared to go there. If someone was exposed to the radiation in the room, they would die within ten minutes, so whoever entered would have to wear personal protective equipment and could stay in the room for no more than an hour.
   
   "Lucky looks so bloody and disfigured. It must have been in the room for more than an hour!"deduced the intelligent Ms Potato,earning nods of approval.
   
   "Too bad there isn't a CCTV in the power reactor room.It would make identifying the culprit much easier,"sighed Kazuha,appearing dismayed. Yet I could sense a hint of satisfaction in her eyes. _Was she-_
   
   No. It couldn't be. _Stop overthinking, Mitsuki Chiaki. Kazuha is the chairperson of the Hillyse Assiociation. She's one of the kindest people you know and your best friend after Miyuki. It isn't her. You're overthinking._
   
   I was so lost in my train of thoughts, I did not notice that most people had left the hall already. I decided to make my way back to my room,brushing away all negative thoughts.
