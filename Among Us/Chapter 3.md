_Aki's POV_

  I didn't even bother to knock.I didn't care if my hair was messy,I didn't care that I might be disturbing an important coversation.
  
  _But what was more important than this?_
  
  I pushed open the door and slammed the tube on the table.Without hesitation or consideration, I blurted out,"I suspect that-"
  
  "Ms Mitsuki! Do you know that it is extremely rude to interrupt-"Obscurus, a smart but rule-loving lady,did not let me finish my sentence.
  
  "She must have something important to say, or else she would not barge in. You may take your leave,Obscurus."
  
  Obscurus glared at me with bulging eyes before exiting the office. I sat down on one of the two velvet wing chairs before taking a glance around to make sure that only two people were listening.
