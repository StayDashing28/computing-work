  "W...What do you mean?" I could not believe my ears.What was going on? I had hoped that Cherry and Lucky's deaths were accidents. I could no longer hope so. 
  
  "Well,we will explain everything later.Aki, are you okay with telling the class your suspicions?" asked Ninja24. Aki bit her lip and nodded. I really hoped that she was wrong. I didn't-I couldn't believe that my friends were _murderers._
