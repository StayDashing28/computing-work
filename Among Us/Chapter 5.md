Miyuki's POV:

  "W...What do you mean?" I could not believe my ears.What was going on? I had hoped that Cherry and Lucky's deaths were accidents. I could no longer hope so. 
  
  "Well,we will explain everything later.Aki, are you okay with telling the class your suspicions?" asked Ninja24. Aki bit her lip and nodded. I really hoped that she was wrong. I didn't-I couldn't believe that my friends were _murderers._
  
Aki's POV:

  I took a deep breath and looked at the suspects. Tears welled up in my eyes. I could no longer see a talented volleyball player. An amazing storyteller. The brightest girl I ever knew. A leader and a friend. 
  
  All I could see, were five murderers. I held back the tears.
  
3rd POV:
  It had been half an hour since Cherry's death had been announced.Some of the girls were planning Cherry's funeral. Some others were doing their own things. However, a scream jolted everyone out of their wits. 
  
  "PEOPLE!"It was no surprise that the scream was made by Josh. He then proceeded to tell everyone in a softer voice, "Some of us have some things to say."
  
  All eyes were on Ninja24 as he was the first one to break the deafening silence. "We think we know who murdered Lucky and Cherry." His statement was greeted with shocks and whispers. 

  "Do you have any evidence-"rebutted Obscurus, who was interrupted by Bobby, who claimed that she murdered Lucky.Needless to say, this caused further uproar.
  
  Bobby whipped out his phone and showed the public a photograph he had taken of Obsurcus wiping fur down her skirt during the emergency meeting where Lucky was announced death. Beads of sweat were also rolling down her forehead then. "I had intended to use this unglam against her, but it ended up becoming a piece of evidence!"Bobby exclaimed. He also showed everyone footage of Obscurus holding Lucky in her arms from the CCTV.
  
 "SMACK!"Obscurus was greeted by a slap on the face by a wailing Becky. A fight almost ensued between the two,when Obscurus suddenly shouted,"I was instructed to do so!"

  "We jolly know you were, it was Kasumi Hibino,"uttered WolfRaider, another one of Ninja24's friends.
  
  "The surname comes first,mister.And who are you to accuse my sister?"Kazuha glared at WolfRaider with bulging eyes. WolfRaider calmly placed his phone on the table and played a recording. 
  
  "_I..It was Kasumi! S...She saw me stealing from the class fund, so she threatened me and asked me to do something bad. i cannot tell you what I did. I...I had no choice! Here's the money!"_ Obscurus' voice was crystal clear. Apparently, before Aki barged in, Obscurus had confessed to Ninja24, who was calling WolfRaider before.He forgot to hang up, so Wolfraider heard and recorded everything.
  
  Kasumi cupped her face in her hands. Needless to say, she was Becky's next target. Kasumi confessed to ordering Obscurus to kill Lucky, as Lucky had licked her dress before.

  "That gives you NO reason to kill Lucky!"roared Becky, whose heart was probably already in a million pieces.Some comforted Becky, some insulted the two culprits.No one seemed to notice that a new clip was being played on the visualiser-it was of an abnormally tall figure placing a sharp black object in Cherry's sofa.
  
   There was only one person in the Hillyse Assiociation of such height.

   Bangxtwice turned around to look at her friend, pure horror drawn on her face.She felt betrayed and disbelief at the same time.However,Heather was quick to dismiss, saying that the CCTV footage could not prove anything.

  "But a dead person can,"smirked Vincent, the vice-chairperson of the Hillyse Assiociation.
