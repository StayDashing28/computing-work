Miyuki's POV:

  "W...What do you mean?" I could not believe my ears.What was going on? I had hoped that Cherry and Lucky's deaths were accidents. I could no longer hope so. 
  
  "Well,we will explain everything later.Aki, are you okay with telling the class your suspicions?" asked Ninja24. Aki bit her lip and nodded. I really hoped that she was wrong. I didn't-I couldn't believe that my friends were _murderers._

Beads of sewat were also rolling down her forehead then. "I had intended to use this unglam against her, but it ended up becoming a piece of evidence!"Bobby exclaimed. He also showed everyone footage of Obscurus holding Lucky in her arms from the CCTV.
  
 "SMACK!"Obscurus was greeted by a slap on the face by a wailing Becky. A fight almost ensued between the two,when Obscurus suddenly shouted,"I was instructed to do so!"
