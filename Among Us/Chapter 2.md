_Unknown POV_

  I plopped myself onto the comofortable couch after completing all my work.I was about to reach for the television remote when I felt a sharp pain in my butt. Ugh, what exactly was it stopping me from enjoying myself after an arduous day? I stood up and saw the culprit of my pain-a suspicious-looking object. Why?I had never seen it before! How did this get in my residence and what was it? A myriad of questions ran through my head and my first instinct was to report this to Kazuha.
  _No, don't. This is just a trivial matter, why trouble her? She is very busy._ On second thought, I decided to let the matter rest since I was not hurt and the object seemed harmless. I placed the object on my table and went back to watching TV.However,I decided to check the couch first this time before sitting down.
