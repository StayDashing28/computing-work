_Unknown POV_

  I plopped myself onto the comofortable couch after completing all my work.I was about to reach for the television remote when I felt a sharp pain in my butt. Ugh, what exactly was it stopping me from enjoying myself after an arduous day? I stood up and saw the culprit of my pain-a suspicious-looking object. Why?I had never seen it before! How did this get in my residence and what was it? A myriad of questions ran through my head and my first instinct was to report this to Kazuha.
  _No, don't. This is just a trivial matter, why trouble her? She is very busy._ On second thought, I decided to let the matter rest since I was not hurt and the object seemed harmless. I placed the object on my table and went back to watching TV.However,I decided to check the couch first this time before sitting down. 
  
_A few days later_ >3rd POV<
  "Aki! Sumi!"shouted Miyuki elatedly as she ran down the hallway to her best friends Chiaki and Kasumi.She was eager to show them a comic she had just completed. In her excitement,she did not notice what was in front of her.
  Smash!Miyuki tripped and fell on the ground."Ow!It hurts!"she groaned.Upon hearing their best friend's call for help,Chiaki and Kasumi dashes towards Miyuki.They helped her up and asked her if she was okay. 
  "I'm alright,"answered Miyuki, to which Kasumi heaved a sigh of relief.However,Chiaki picked up what had caused her friend to fall.It was a broken lipstick.She scrutinised it closely and noticed the words "Cherry Crush" engraved on the metal tube.
  Chiaki could not believe what she was seeing and what she was feeling, at all. Her gut instincts were always right. But for this instance,she hoped they were wrong.Utterly wrong.
