_Disclaimer: Cherry is an oc, she is not supposed to represent anyone in the class.I just made her up cause I didn't want to kill off anyone in the class cause I'm the nicest :)_

3rd POV:

  A myriad of many diffreent feelings were present in the room,all of which were reactions to seeing the shroud on the wooden table. Bangxtwice, who was scared of dead bodies,wept into Heather's shoulder. Some insenstive people were laughing and making jokes about the corpse. Meanwhile, Aki only had one question in her mind:Was it _her_ who did it?
  
  Cherry was not an official part of the Hillyse Assiociation,but everyone knew her quite well as she worked at the reception counter. Her corpse had been found at the staircase landing by Josh,who went to go take out the trash as it was his duty that day. Upon seeing Cherry lying motionlessly on the ground, he dashed upstairs and called for an emergency meeting.
  
  Obsurcus was examining Cheery's dead body.She reached into Cherry's pockets to find a piece of crumpled paper.However,she could not decipher the message on it as it was written in a foreign language. _ten cuidado con la hoja brumosa_, it read.
  
  "Hey! I know what that means!" exclaimed Ariel who had been looking over Obsurcus'shoulder.Everyone looked at her in shock, with some even calling her a genius. "Guys, I am not a genius. I  know what it means because it is in Spanish. It means be careful of misty leaf. What is that even supposed to mean?"Most were puzzled and discussed among themselves what Cherry meant, and why she even wrote the message in Spanish.
  
Miyuki's POV:
  I could not believe my ears.Mist. Leaf Didn't that mean-
  
  _Wait.I have to tell Aki._ Without second thoughts, I ran towards Aki, who was clutching something in her hand, arms crossed.She seemed deep in thought.Was she having the same thoughts as me? But why was she holding something
  
  "Aki, what are you holding?" I inquired her. She turned around to face me, her face as pale as wax. She didn't want to say anything, but I looked at her pleadingly. I got a two things in return-a sigh, and probably the greatest shock of my life. 
  
  Pulling me aside, she told me all her thoughts. I really hoped she was talking gibberish, but her words made perfect sense.
