**â€œEmergency Meeting!"**
   I sighed in annoyance at the sight of the words on my smartwatch. Was it Jiangyou playing pranks again? This was the fifth time today! Grudgingly,I made my way to the hall.        "I swear, if I catch Jiangyou pressing the button again, I will-"declared jaleen angrily.Many others nodded in agreement, as no one liked to climb down flights of stairs and climb up to the sixth floor again upon realising that nothing had happened. Just then, I caught sight of Jiangyou, the infamous class clown, running into the hallway while panting.
    He was followed by a weeping Wen Han, who held a white blanket in his/her hands. Whispers echoed throughout the hall as (someone0 gingerly placed the  blanket on the long marble table, only to reveal a bloody mess inside.
    "M...My dog() was k..killed. Who can be so cruel as to do such an evil deed?" wailed (someone).
     Some of (someone's) friends went to comfort him/her, while the investigative chairperson, Yan Ching, asked:"Where did you find (dog's) body?"
