_parody of the song feel special_

(Please go listen it's a bop)

On the first day
We thought you were very strict
And I felt so shy
Didn't want to say a word

Well then it all changed
You made the lessons very fun
We all learnt a lot from you
Although you do scold us
We know that you just want to teach us
Thank you for helping us learn!

Thank you for teaching us
At times we might be disappointing
But you never give up on us
Although your words might seem harsh
We know you mean well

Thanks for being a great teacher
Although sometimes we make you frustrated
And end up getting scolded
You still never fail to,
teach us,help us learn

Your art
Never fails to make us laugh
Your tales
Always manages to relax our minds
Sometimes you might chide us
But we know it's to help us
Thank you for being such a great teacher!

Even though some of us
Do not hand in our homework
You still forgive us
And help us learn
Even though we messed up the comprehension

Thank you for teaching us
Our essays might be disappointing
But you never give up on us
Although your words might seem harsh
We know you mean well

Thanks for being a great teacher
Although sometimes we make you frustrated
And end up getting scolded
You still never fail to,
teach us,help us learn
