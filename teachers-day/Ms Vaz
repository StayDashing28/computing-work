_parody of the song feel special_

(Please go listen it's a bop)

On the first day<br/>
We thought you were very strict<br/>
And I felt so shy<br/>
Didn't want to say a word<br/>

Well then it all changed<br/>
You made the lessons very fun<br/>
We all learnt a lot from you<br/>
Although you do scold us<br/>
We know that you just want to teach us<br/>
Thank you for helping us learn!<br/>

Thank you for teaching us<br/>
At times we might be disappointing<br/>
But you never give up on us<br/>
Although your words might seem harsh<br/>
We know you mean well<br/>

Thanks for being a great teacher<br/>
Although sometimes we make you frustrated<br/>
And end up getting scolded<br/>
You still never fail to,<br/>
teach us,help us learn<br/>

We will never forget your lessons<br/>
But we sometimes don't listen to your methods<br/>
And we have to do it again<br/>
Which helps us to learn it again<br/>
Thank you for being such a great teacher!<br/>

Even though some of us<br/>
Do not hand in our homework<br/>
You still forgive us<br/>
And help us learn<br/>
Even though we messed up the comprehension<br/>

Thank you for teaching us<br/>
Our essays might be disappointing<br/>
But you never give up on us<br/>
Although your words might seem harsh<br/>
We know you mean well<br/>

Sometimes you can be really stern<br/>
But other times your words can be hilarious<br/>
Although at times you can be painfully honest<br/>
We still see your concern for us<br/>
Thank you for teaching us!<br/>

You teach us until we get it right<br/>
Even if we get bad grades<br/>
You never give up on us<br/>
Even though you said you have no paitience<br/>
That's what you do<br/>
And all of us owe it to you<br/>
For being such a great teacher<br/>

Thank you for teaching us<br/>
Sometimes we might really enrage you<br/>
with our poor spelling and grammar<br/>

But you never gave up on us<br/>
For nine months<br/>
And we all know<br/>
That you're a really special teacher<br/>

Happy Teacher's day, Ms Vaz!!
