_parody of the song feel special_

(Please go listen it's a bop)

On the first day
We thought you were very strict
And I felt so shy
Didn't want to say a word

Well then it all changed
You made the lessons very fun
We all learnt a lot from you
Although you do scold us
We know that you just want to teach us
Thank you for helping us learn!

Thank you for teaching us
At times we might be disappointing
But you never give up on us
Although your words might seem harsh
We know you mean well

Thanks for being a great teacher
Although sometimes we make you frustrated
And end up getting scolded
You still never fail to,
teach us,help us learn

We will never forget your lessons
But we sometimes don't listen to your methods
And we have to do it again
Which helps us to learn it again
Thank you for being such a great teacher!

Even though some of us
Do not hand in our homework
You still forgive us
And help us learn
Even though we messed up the comprehension

Thank you for teaching us
Our essays might be disappointing
But you never give up on us
Although your words might seem harsh
We know you mean well

Sometimes you can be really stern
But other times your words can be hilarious
Although at times you can be painfully honest
We still see your concern for us
Thank you for teaching us!

You teach us until we get it right
Even if we get bad grades
You never give up on us
Even though you said you have no paitience
That's what you do
And all of us owe it to you
For being such a great teacher

Thank you for teaching us
Sometimes we might really enrage you
with our poor spelling and grammar

But you never gave up on us
For nine months
And we all know
That you're a really special teacher 

Happy Teacher's day, Ms Vaz!!
